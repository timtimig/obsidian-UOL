We do not recommend that you study combinations of modules that require more than two programming languages at the same time. This will give you the best chance to master the topics covered and achieve the module learning outcomes. These are the programming languages in each module.
For example, if you were to study Introduction to Programming 2, Programming with Data and Object Oriented Programming, you would be using Javascript, C++ and Python. We do not recommend this. In addition, we advise you to take Software Design and Development in your second or third batch of Level 5 modules.
