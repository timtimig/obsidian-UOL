- follow guidelines and be consistent
- avoid bias. Only a person's work, not personality
- remind peers what they are doing well
- give concrete examples and advices. Try to explain why something could be improved and provide details
- try to be kind, polite and helpful. "It'd be great" instead "you have to"

#### Qualities of strong feedback (F.A.S.T.)
Begin your feedback with at least one positive comment. Be respectful and constructive by starting out with positive feedback before giving your critical feedback.

Strong feedback has 4 characteristics:
##### Feed-forward
Feed-forward feedback tells learners how your feedback will help them succeed in future assignments or reach their goals related to what is coming up in class. Feed-forward feedback is focused on _goals_ and _the future._ That’s why it’s important to give learners a forward reference point.
**Positive examples**:
"Implementing this feedback will help you do better on the next peer review assignment"
"Making these changes will help you code faster, so you will be a more efficient programmer"
**Negative examples**:
"Think about this feedback carefully"
"You should make these changes"

##### Actionable
Feedback should be specific, useful, and provide _actionable_ information. For example, saying “good job!” or “you didn’t follow the instructions” are not actionable or useful. What _specifically_ should the learner do more or less of next time?
**Positive examples**:
"I like how you answered the question in two paragraphs, as the instructions asked for. One way to improve it can be…."
Please limit your answer to 2 paragraphs of 5-8 sentences each."
"Your charts convey all the required information. It can be made more readable by changing the axis limits."
"You commented on the business’ financial position but did not include supporting data. Include specific profitability and liquidity data to support your argument"
**Negative examples**:
"Good job!"
"This is too long."
"Your chart isn't very clear."
"Your argument isn’t strong. It’s not very clear."
##### Succinct
Pick 2-3 key pieces of feedback that learners should focus on. Change based on this feedback should make a significant, positive difference in their next draft.
##### Timely
The sooner the feedback, the better. Feedback should ideally be given within one day and no longer than 2 days after submission.
